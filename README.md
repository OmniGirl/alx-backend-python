# ALX Backend Python Projects

This repository contains backend engineering projects written in Python, completed as part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum. These projects cover foundational backend concepts such as type annotations, asynchronous programming, and unit/integration testing.

---

## Key Concepts Covered

- Python type hints and variable annotations
- Asynchronous programming with `async` and `await`
- Async comprehensions and generators
- Unit testing and integration testing using `unittest`
- Performance handling in async tasks

## Project Structure

```
0x00-python_variable_annotations/
0x01-python_async_function/
0x02-python_async_comprehension/
0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests/
```

Each folder contains focused exercises and scripts that explore core backend principles.
